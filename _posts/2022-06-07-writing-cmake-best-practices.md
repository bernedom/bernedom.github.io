When packt publishing approached me in august 2021 with the idea of writing a book about CMake I immediately was all for it and ten of the most intense months later "CMake Best Practices" finally hit the shelves. The writing journey during these ten months were super interesting but also very exhausting and a constant emotional rollercoaster. In the end having been able to write a book with packt publishing was a very valuable experience and seeing the book being sold and receiving the first reviews is very satisfing but there were quite a few moments of doubt in these ten months. So how was writing the book? 

# How does packt go about writing books

1. Write a pitch for the book, target audience and rough contents
1. Write an outline and give an approximate number of pages - Source of much grief and discussion later on
1. Contract  - OK, small writing fee and royalties - No idea if this is fair or not
1. Go on writing, chapter by chapter 
   1. Write a first draft & code examples
   1. Corrections
   1. Technical review 
   1. Rewrites
   1. Done - Extra rounds not really planned in, but possible
1. Finishing touches, publishing and promotion

Thoughts? 

* Packts writing process
* time pressure and schedule
* contract negotiations
* communication
* writing partner - it either works or not
* tooling - Ugh 
    - Grammarly, spell checker
    - Word review is aweful

# Would I do it again? 

Mixed feelings, interesting experience for first time authors. Improved my writing skills and approach to get things written. Writing again besides a full time job? probably not with this timeframe.
