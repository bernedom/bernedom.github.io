**Finding the right partner for your software development project is difficult.** Lot's of companies have a high demand for software development, but most often they do not have the capacity to do it all themselves. So the solution is often to turn to one of the many companies or freelancers that offer software development services. But finding the right partner can prove difficult. In my years as software contractor I was frequently on the offering side as a senior software engineer and now that I work on the other side I am involved in finding contractors for software development projects or products. So how does one go about to find a good match for a software project? 

## A good match

So what is a good match? Generally a good match is if the client and the contracting company can work together effortlessly and without escalating conflicts. This boils down to finding a satisfying way to work together and delivering a suitable solution in a timely manner and within budget. And of the three getting along well is the base foundation that enables the possibility for the other three to be achieved. Having a budget and a timeline are useful constraints to set for a contract but before that the ability to build a suitable solution is worth much more or you might end up with a bad solution that is delivered on time and within budget.

## Know what problem you want to solve

Before starting to look for a contractor make sure that you understand what problems to solve and have in-depth discussions if creating a software solution for it is really the way to go. It helps if you can define the measurement of success for an undertaking in a concise way. Something like: "If we unify all our services behind a single API, we can reduce the number of support tickets by 50%". Or "If we move to a digital solution for disposition of the service workers we can send out bills continuously instead of only once a week and thus avoid a lot of overtime for our administrative staff." Whatever the problem is, make sure that you can define it in a way that you can measure the success of the project and be able to formulate this concisely. I had quite a few talks with potential customers that wanted a fancy solution to a problem that they were unable to define on a high level. In these cases we would rather offer to help them define the problem before committing to actually doing any software development. This could lead to a good collaboration but more often it ended up in either us not getting the project or projects with frequent conflicts about the direction of the project and if the money spent was worth it.

* talk about how to work together 
* Talk to the engineers that acutally do the work early on
* Be clear about budget but flexible on the timeline
* Think about further development after the end
  * Internalizing?
  * Develop it further? 
  * Call it OK and just maintain it? 
* No fixed scope, fix budet if needed. 
* Not an estimate but a feasibility / confident vote if it can be done in the given time and budget
* How do you work together (Scrum in sprints is OK)
  * Who owns the backlog, who formulates the requirements?
  * Who is in the BL refinement sessions? (How do you do BL refinement)
  * Who takes part in the planning
  * How are reviews conducted?
    * What if a review fails? Do not pay? 
    * What if there are no reviews? Do not pay?
