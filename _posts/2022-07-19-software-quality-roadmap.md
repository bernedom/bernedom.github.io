"We really struggle to bring engineering topics into the roadmap! When do we finally get the time to improve our code quality?" Is a gripe that many software engineering teams have when doing roadmaps. Improving or working on software quality often comes second when software roadmaps are formulated. After all, it is often very hard to argue what the direct customer value for improved maintainability is. Nevertheless creating quality software is a necessity if products are expected to perform on the market and be developed for a long time. It is not that the business-facing people in software development such as POs, marketing, sales and so on are not interested in having a quality product at their hand. The reason is more often that we engineers are very badly prepared to hold a constructive dialog on software quality with people with a less technical focus. 

The first of the problems is that lot's of team struggle to define software quality in the first place and just refer to any of the work on improving a codebase as "refactoring" or "working on tech debt". While both are very important things to do and engineers probably have quite a clear idea what this entails, they do not serve well when talking with non-technical people or when creating a plan. 
Today's software engineering is often very value driven. If one cannot argue the value of an intended task it will be deprioritized. So if we want to bring software quality topics into the planning discussions, we have to change our approach.
