**"How long do you think is the lifetime of your software product?"** - I like to ask this question frequently when people start working on something new. The answers ranged from a few months to a few years, and what they usually have in common is that they are underestimating this by a magnitude. This might be peculiar to the industries I am working in, but almost all of the software products I worked on had their lifetime measured in decades rather than years. 

There are several software 

## Braindump

* We want to be done soon -> later dev slows down because it is a mess
    * More and more engineers are thrown onto a project but it doesn't get better --> engineering bloat
* Companies underestimate the length of maintenance for software products - often a few months to years but reality is often decades
* Skills for building long term maintainable stuff hard
* No clear picture of the evolution -> Are we done with features after a few years? Are we adding new features?
    * Sunk cost fallacy -> tinkering with old, reliable stuff is not sexy --> adding new look and feels without functionality
        - digital analphabets cannot use old products
* deprecation is hard and is a skill
* saying no to adding useless features and starting a new project
    * think about integration of existing products into new products
