**We can't release every two weeks, we're not a web company.** Despite agile software development being around for over 20 years now and companies small and large adopting it with varying degrees of proficiency, one thing I still see happening frequently is the big bang release. Maybe this is a particularity to the industry I work in, but I see it happening in many companies and teams. 




* Need to coordinate with marketing etc - want to advertise
* Feature flags, make it visible later
* updating and rolling out are a non-event for users
* seperate deployment from release - deployment is a technical task, release is a business task
