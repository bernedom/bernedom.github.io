title: The Mountain Mind - Mountain climbing and software development are the same
description: Taking and assessing risks, commitment and focus on the task play an important role when climbing as well as when writing software. A few thoughts on how being a successful mountaineer influences my work as a software engineer and what can be learned from being in the great outdoors.

When planning a climbing trip the goal - reaching the summit - is often known, but how the actual climb that leads up there is something that can only be judged once the climbing actually starts. There are mountains that look almost impossible to climb and yet they are relatively easy to summit, while others look comparatively tame but require quite some effort to get up to. When starting out with a software project it is often quite similar, while we might have a general idea on what problem or business case we want to solve with the software, is often unclear how we get there. We might not yet know the team well enough or we might not be familiar with some of the technology involved. when mountain climbing it is quite the same, we might climb the first time with the other person, we might not know where the crux - the most difficult part of the wall - is and how the weather is going to develop. But nevertheless, if one wants to summit a mountain, one has to start climbing and if one wants to ship software one has to start coding. 

## Commitment is needed for success

No matter how the preconditions were, once the climbing or the software development started, it needs a certain commitment from those involved, or else one plods along listlessly. People need to be engaged and be able to focus without distraction on the project ahead. As climbing and coding both are flow-based activities, the goal for maximum progress is to reach a flow state of mind. Being *committed* to a project means being fully involved and explicitly saying "yes" to the the undertaking. Committed people are also willing to invest time, nerves and energy to reach the common goal. 

For software development, this means that one commits to the product - even if it sometimes might be difficult to go forward. Sometimes a bit of grit, resolve and stamina is needed to overcome a nasty situation. Generally the further one progresses, either in climbing or in software development, the bigger the negative consequences of abandoning the project are. When developing software this often comes down to having wasted quite large amounts of money, when climbing this could mean that one has to be rescued out of a wall or worse. 

For every ambitious undertaking one has to recognize that it might get tough sometimes and that there might be moments when the frustration might be high. But if people are committed they accept this willingly. 

On the other hand being committed means taking over responsibility for ones actions. If the lead climber chooses as more interesting way than planned this means everybody else has to follow that way, even if the difficulty might be increases. When software engineers take technical decisions regarding a project, this affects the people tasked with maintaining or further developing the product in the future. 

## Risk assessments and risk awareness

It's not just the developers that need to be committed. The customer or sponsor of a project also has to invest their commitment, if one wants a project to succeed. If a customer backs up a project unconditionally and is willing to invest time and expertise the risk of failing to ship the software successfully dramatically decreases. Customers that have a hard time expressing their wishes regarding a product or that are unwilling to invest time on their side to further a project might be a hint for lack of commitment. 

Another large factor to influence the level of commitment is the risks involved in doing something new. Some risks that can be reduced and controlled to some part, but there are also inherent risks in doing something like software engineering or mountain climbing. In the mountains the weather might change suddenly, a rock can break loose or material fatigue might cause an anchor to fail. Or a global pandemic might disrupt the economy, a critical security bug might be happening in a widely used library. These risks, often very unlikely to happen, are not reducible.

There are however many risks that can be mitigated very well. Over the years I identitified three major factors that contribute to increased risk and accidents when climbing or developing software: Ignorance, Causalness and distraction. 

{%include figure.html url="images/mountain-mind/accidents-reasons.png" description="The three main reasons for increased risks and accidents" %}

*Ignorance* means that we just do not know enough or that our skills are not developed far enough. Reducing ignorance is done by learning and gathering experience which is relatively easy achieved by regular training and education. in this context *casualness* means, that we underestimate the seriousness of the situation or overestimate our abilities to solve a problem. Reducing *casualness* is done by increasing the system awareness and getting a grasp of the surrounding context. Retrospectives and reflecting together are good methods to achieve this. *Distraction* means that we cannot focus on the task at hand for whatever reason. This is where commitment and focus come into play. 

## The circle of risk and commitment 

The combination of focus and commitment reduces the risks. If we work on a product that is only a triviality and a side-project of a customer the risk of failure or not reaching the goal is often increased. Typical symptoms are inabilty to define clear goals, roadmaps or the responsible persons being unreliably available. 

When climbing having a distracted or uncommited member in the party might put the whole rope team into danger. Unfortunately the feeling of being in danger is highly distracting for most people which if not solved creates a vicious cycle where the risks are ever increased until either an accident happens or the project is abandoned. Added to this is the fact that people not being committed to a project often tend to estimate risks higher.

{%include figure.html url="images/mountain-mind/comittment-risk-cycle_influences.png" description="How risk and committment influence each other the factors to influence the cycle" %}

There are various influencing factors that we can control to escape that vicious cycle. Reflecting in the team about the risk and their individual risk perception is a great start - no matter if climbing or hacking. Learning to keep the focus despite being scared is a great asset. Exposing yourself to the risks in a controlled environment can be a very effective way for learning this. When climbing this could mean going to the climbing-gym and falling in the rope on purpose. When writing software this can be done with hackathons, coding dojos and so on. 
Another leverage to break the cycle is to give people the time and context to be able to focus on the project on hand. This means not overloading them with various different tasks and projects and creating stable teams where people feel safe and where it is easy to get help. Having a team that knows how each individual perceives risks and how people react to perceived danger is a great lever to break the cycle. No matter if the goal is reaching the summit of a mountain or delivering awesome products to users.
