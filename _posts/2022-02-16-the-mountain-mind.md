title: The Mountain Mind - Mountain climbing and software development are the same
description: Taking and assessing risks, commitment and focus on the task play an important role when climbing as well as when writing software. A few thoughts on how being a successful mountaineer influences my work as a software engineer and what can be learned from being in the great outdoors.

When planning a climbing trip the goal - reaching the summit - is often known, but how the actual climb that leads up there is something that can only be judged once the climbing actually starts. There are mountains that look almost impossible to climb and yet they are relatively easy to summit, while others look comparatively tame but require quite some effort to get up to. When starting out with a software project it is often quite similar, while we might have a general idea on what problem or business case we want to solve with the software, is often unclear how we get there. We might not yet know the team well enough or we might not be familiar with some of the technology involved. when mountain climbing it is quite the same, we might climb the first time with the other person, we might not know where the crux - the most difficult part of the wall - is and how the weather is going to develop. But nevertheless, if one wants to summit a mountain, one has to start climbing and if one wants to ship software one has to start coding. 

## Commitment is needed for success

No matter how the preconditions were, once the climbing or the software development started, it needs a certain commitment from those involved, or else one plods along listlessly. People need to be engaged and be able to focus without distraction on the project ahead. As climbing and coding both are flow-based activities, the goal for maximum progress is to reach a flow state of mind. Being *committed* to a project means being fully involved and explicitly saying "yes" to the the undertaking. Committed people are also willing to invest time, nerves and energy to reach the common goal. 

For software development, this means that one commits to the product - even if it sometimes might be difficult to go forward. Sometimes a bit of grit, resolve and stamina is needed to overcome a nasty situation. Generally the further one progresses, either in climbing or in software development, the bigger the negative consequences of abandoning the project are. When developing software this often comes down to having wasted quite large amounts of money, when climbing this could mean that one has to be rescued out of a wall or worse. 

For every ambitious undertaking one has to recognize that it might get tough sometimes and that there might be moments when the frustration might be high. But if people are committed they accept this willingly. 

On the other hand being committed means taking over responsibility for ones actions. If the lead climber chooses as more interesting way than planned this means everybody else has to follow that way, even if the difficulty might be increases. When software engineers take technical decisions regarding a project, this affects the people tasked with maintaining or further developing the product in the future. 

## Risk assessments and risk awareness

It's not just the developers that need to be committed. The customer or sponsor of a project also has to invest their commitment, if one wants a project to succeed. If a customer backs up a project unconditionally and is willing to invest time and expertise the risk of failing to ship the software successfully dramatically decreases. Customers that have a hard time expressing their wishes regarding a product or that are unwilling to invest time on their side to further a project might be a hint for lack of commitment. 

Another large factor to influence the level of commitment is the risks involved in doing something new. There are risks that can be reduced and controlled to some part, but there are also inherent risks in doing something like software engineering or mountain climbing. In the mountains the weather might change suddenly, a rock can break loose or material fatigue might cause an anchor to fail. Or a global pandemic might disrupt the economy, a critical security bug might be happening in a widely used library. These risk, often very unlikely to happen, are not really reductable.
