In recent years, I have conducted numerous workshops and training sessions to help teams improve their software delivery processes and CMake skills. 

All workshops can be tailored to your team's needs, ranging from small 2-hour sessions to full-day or multi-day workshops.Here are some of the workshops I offer: 

# CMake Workshops
