Do you struggle to release your software on time? Are you facing challenges with your development processes and is your
release cycle too long? I can help you identify bottlenecks, streamline your workflows, and implement best practices to
ensure timely and efficient software delivery:

* On site or remote consulting
* Assess your current software delivery processes
* Identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement
* Implement best practices for software development and delivery
* Hands-on streamlining of CI/CD systems
* Support your teams to build up effective platforms for software delivery

## Platform Engineering

Enable teams with a paved road and self-service tooling by introducing an Internal Developer Platform (IDP).

* Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi, Crossplane) with GitOps
* Secure multi-tenancy, networking, secrets, and SSO across teams
* Observability stacks (metrics, logs, traces) and SLOs
* Policy as code (OPA) and automated compliance

### DevOps Services

Adopt modern delivery practices and automation.

* CI/CD architecture and optimization (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Argo CD/Flux)
* Trunk-based development, feature flags, and progressive delivery (canary/blue-green)
* Automated testing strategy: unit, integration, contract, end-to-end
* Supply chain security: SAST/DAST, dependency scanning, SBOM, signing (SLSA)
* Environment management and infrastructure automation
* Incident response, SRE practices, runbooks, and postmortems
