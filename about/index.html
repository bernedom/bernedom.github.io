I am Dominik, a professional software engineer, blogger, and conference speaker with 20 years of professional software
development under my belt. I code mainly in C++ and have worked on many software projects, from writing bleeding-edge
software for surgical simulators in a startup, to maintaining large legacy platforms for large corporations in the
MedTech industry, to creating IoT solutions and writing pilot software for drones. I believe that well-designed and
maintained build environments are one of the key elements to enable teams to write software efficiently and excel at
creating quality software. When I am not writing code, I occasionally write articles for my blog or speak at conferences
about software development.

Modern software development is a team sport that no longer happens behind closed doors. As a professional C++ developer
and agilist I believe that software projects do not have to be painful and risky to execute.
