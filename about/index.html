I am Dominik, a professional software engineer, blogger, and conference speaker with 20 years of professional software
development under my belt. I code mainly in C++ and have worked on many software projects, from writing bleeding-edge
software for surgical simulators in a startup, to maintaining large legacy platforms for large corporations in the
MedTech industry, to creating IoT solutions and writing pilot software for drones. I believe that well-designed and
maintained build environments are one of the key elements to enable teams to write software efficiently and excel at
creating quality software. When I am not writing code, I occasionally write articles for my blog or speak at conferences
about software development.

Modern software development is a team sport that no longer happens behind closed doors. As a professional C++ developer
and agilist I believe that software projects do not have to be painful and risky to execute.

The articles on this blog have been written by me without the use of any AI like ChatGPT except for
[grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to help with spelling and grammar.
