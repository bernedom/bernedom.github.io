  - title: Secure Boot & Encryption-At-Rest for Embedded Linux Device
    subtitle: SoftwareCraft added secure boot and encryption-at-rest capabilities to an embedded Linux device trough yocto.
    description: |-
      Security is a major concern for embedded devices, especially those deployed in the field. SoftwareCraft implemented secure boot and encryption-at-rest features for an embedded Linux device using the Yocto Project.
    features:
      - Creating custom yocto layers to enable trusted boot support
      - Enable LUKS encryption for data at rest during provisioning
      - On-device-provisioning through simple deployment
      - Per-device unique keys stored in secure hardware
      - Allow A/B Over-the-Air-Updates with signed images
